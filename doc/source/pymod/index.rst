*****
PyMØD
*****

This is the Python 3 bindings for libMØD, which adds additional interface functionality
on top of the library.
The module can be used as normal Python module (i.e., with ``import mod``)
though it might often be easier to use it simply by running the wrapper script (:ref:`mod-wrapper`)
which automatically sets ``PYTHONPATH`` and inserts a small preamble.
