This page contains the core functionality for composing rules and creating rules from graphs.
Note that there is both a low-level interface for constructing expressions,
and an embedded mini-language for defining the expressions using normal Python operators.

The Embedded Rule Composition Expression Language
#################################################

The embedded language is really a collection of proxy classes with a lot of operator overloading, thus
the normal syntax and semantics of Python applies.

A rule composition expression always returns a list of rules when evaluated.
The following is the grammar for the expressions.

.. productionlist:: rcExp
   rcExp: `rcExp` `op` `rcExp`
        : "rcBind(" graphs ")"
        : "rcUnbind(" graphs ")"
        : "rcId(" graphs ")"
        : rules
   op: "*" `opObject` "*"
   opObject: "rcParallel"
           : "rcSuper(allowPartial=False)"
           : "rcSuper"
           : "rcSub(allowPartial=False)"
           : "rcSub"
           : "rcCommon"

Here a ``graphs`` is any Python expression that is either a single :class:`Graph` or an iterable of graphs.
Similarly, ``rules`` must be either a :class:`Rule` or an iterable of rules.
An :token:`~rcExp:rcExp` may additionally be an iterable of expressions.
See the API below for more details on the semantics of each expression,
and the corresponding :ref:`C++ page<cpp-rule/CompositionExpr>`.

Expression Evaluator
#################################################

.. class:: RCEvaluator

    This class can evaluate rule composition expressions. During evaluation an expression graph is recorded.

    The expression graph is a directed hypergraph :math:`(V, E)`, with each vertex representing a rule.
    Each edge represent all compositions calculated for a unique input. That is every edge :math:`e\in E` is on the form
    :math:`((u, v), R_e)` with :math:`(u, v)\in V\times V` as an *ordered* pair of rules and :math:`R_e\subseteq V` is the set
    of all resulting rules found.

    The graph is visualised as a bipartite graph with point-shaped vertices representing the hyperedges. The in-edges to these
    hyperedge vertices are labelled with 1 and 2.

    .. attribute:: ruleDatabase

        (Read-only) The list of unique rules known by the evaluator.

        :type: list[Rule]
    .. attribute:: products

        (Read-only) The list of unique rules this evaluator has constructed.

        :type: list[Rule]
    .. method:: eval(exp, *, verbosity=0)

        Evaluates a rule composition expression.
        Any created rule is replaced by a rule in the database if they are isomorphic.
        A rule may appear multiple times in the result if multiple overlaps resulted in the same composed rule.

        :param RCExpExp exp: the expression to evaluate.
        :param int verbosity: the level of information being printed about the evaluation.
            See :cpp:func:`rule::Composer::eval` for details.
        :returns: the resulting list of rules of the expression.
        :rtype: list[Rule]
    .. method:: print()

        Print the graph representing all expressions evaluated so far.
.. method:: rcEvaluator(database, labelSettings)

    :param database: a list of isomorphic rules the evaluator will compare against.
    :type database: list[Rule]
    :param LabelSettings labelSettings: the settings to use for morphisms.
    :returns: a rule composition expression evaluator.
    :rtype: RCEvaluator

    .. note:: The caller is responsible for ensuring the given rules are unique.

Rule Composition Expressions
#################################################

An expression, ``RCExpExp``, can be evaluated through the method :meth:`RCEvaluator.eval`.
The result of an expression is a list of rules.

.. class:: RCExpUnion

    Return the union of the subexpressions. I.e., flatten the subresult lists into a single list.

.. class:: RCExpBind

    Return the singleton list with the rule :math:`(\emptyset, \emptyset, G)` for the given graph :math:`G`.

.. class:: RCExpId

    Return the singleton list with the rule :math:`(G, G, G)` for the given graph :math:`G`.

.. class:: RCExpUnbind

    Return the singleton list with the rule :math:`(G, \emptyset, \emptyset)` for the given graph :math:`G`.

.. class:: RCExpExp

    The base class for the composition of two rule :math:`(L_1, K_1, R_1)` and :math:`(L_2, K_2, R_2)`.

.. class:: RCExpComposeCommon

    Compose the rules by all common subgraphs of :math:`R_1` and :math:`L_2`,
    possibly limited to connected subgraphs or to the subgraphs of maximum size.
    By default the empty overlap is not considered, but can be enabled to be.

.. class:: RCExpComposeParallel

    Compose the rules by all common subgraphs of :math:`R_1` and :math:`L_2`,
    possibly limited to connected subgraphs or to the subgraphs of maximum size.

.. class:: RCExpComposeSub

    Compose the rules by the empty graph, i.e., create a rule representing the parallel application of two input rules.

.. class:: RCExpComposeSuper

    Compose the rules such that overlapping connected components of :math:`R_1` and :math:`L_2` have the :math:`L_2` component as a subgraph of :math:`R_1`.
    The overlap is `partial` if not every connected component of :math:`L_2` is participating in the common subgraph.
