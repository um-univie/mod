Class ``rule::Composer``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: rule::Composer
    

    This class can evaluate rule composition expressions. During evaluation an expression graph is recorded.

    The expression graph is a directed hypergraph :math:`(V, E)`, with each vertex representing a rule.
    Each edge represent all compositions calculated for a unique input. That is every edge :math:`e\in E` is on the form
    :math:`((u, v), R_e)` with :math:`(u, v)\in V\times V` as an *ordered* pair of rules and :math:`R_e\subseteq V` is the set
    of all resulting rules found.

    The graph is visualised as a bipartite graph with point-shaped vertices representing the hyperedges. The in-edges to these
    hyperedge vertices are labelled with 1 and 2.

.. cpp:namespace-push:: rule::Composer

.. function:: const std::unordered_set<std::shared_ptr<Rule> > &getRuleDatabase() const

    :returns: the set of unique rules known by the evaluator.
.. function:: const std::unordered_set<std::shared_ptr<Rule> > &getProducts() const

    :returns: the set of unique rules this evaluator has constructed.
.. function:: std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Rule>> eval(const RCExp::Expression &exp, int verbosity)

    Evaluates a rule composition expression.
    Any created rule is replaced by a rule in the database if they are isomorphic.

    A rule may appear multiple times in the result if multiple overlaps resulted in the same composed rule.

    The :var:`verbosity` has the following meaning:

    - 0 (or less): no information is printed.
    - 10: Print information about morphism generation for rule composition.
    - 20: Print rule composition information.

    :returns: the result of the expression.
.. function:: void print() const

    Print the graph representing all expressions evaluated so far.
.. function:: static std::shared_ptr<Composer> create(const std::unordered_set<std::shared_ptr<Rule> > &database, LabelSettings labelSettings)

    :returns: a new instance of an evaluator with its database initialised with the given rules.

    .. note:: The caller is responsible for ensuring the given rules are unique.
