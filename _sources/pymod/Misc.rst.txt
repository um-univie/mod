.. function:: prefixFilename(name)

    Utility function for converting script-relative paths to current-working-directory-relative paths
    (see also :func:`include`).
    This function is used in all PyMØD functions that takes a filename as argument.
    To circumvent this prefixing use the :class:`CWDPath` class.

    :returns: `name` prefixed with all strings pushed with :func:`pushFilePrefix`
        and popped yet.
    :rtype: str

.. function:: pushFilePrefix(s)

    Push another prefix used in :func:`prefixFilename`.
    The prefixes are concatenated in the order they are pushed.
    No directory delimiters are inserted, so they must explicitly be part of the pushed prefixes.
    If the argument starts with ``/``, then during concatenation all previously pushed prefixes are ignored.

    :param str s: the string to push as a prefix to be concatenated in :func:`prefixFilename`.

.. function:: popFilePrefix()

    Pop a previously pushed prefix.

.. class:: CWDPath

    A dummy class to wrap a filename in to disable prefixing.

    For example, if a graph GML file is to be loaded relative to the current file
    (assuming :func:`include` is used for script inclusion), then it can be done with

    .. code-block:: python

        g = graphGML(f)

    If the file is located relative to the current working directory
    (i.e., where the :any:`mod` wrapper script were invoked from), then the graph loading should be done as

    .. code-block:: python

        g = graphGML(CWDPath(f))

    .. method:: __init__(f)

        Wrap a filename.

.. function:: magicLibraryValue()

    :returns: a number unique for each instantiation of libMØD.
        This can be used to check for the diamond problem for shared libraries.
    :rtype: int
.. function:: version()

    :returns: the version of MØD.
    :rtype: str
.. function:: rngReseed(seed)

        Reseed the random bit generator used in the library.
.. function:: rngUniformReal()

        :returns: a uniformly random real number between 0 and 1.
         :rtype: float
