.. class:: DGPrintData

    This class is used to hold extra data about how a specific derivation graph
    is visualised.

    The idea is that in the visualized network each vertex/hyperedge is specified
    by a pair :math:`(id, dup)` where :math:`id` is the ID of the vertex/hyperedge
    and :math:`dup` is an versioning integer that can be specified in objects of this class.

    Initially, each vertex/hyperedge has only one version: duplicate number 0.
    The duplication is primarily specified via the hyperedges, with the duplication
    of vertices being induced afterwards.
    Thus hyperedge duplicates are managed by :func:`makeDuplicate` and :func:`removeDuplicate`,
    while the vertex duplicates are managed implicitly by :func:`reconnectSource` and :func:`reconnectTarget`.
    In the end, when the data is used for printing, it will be compiled to form the actual duplication data.

    .. method:: __init__(dg)

        Construct a data object where all derivations have a single version, duplicate number 0,
        connected to version 0 of all heads and tails.

        :param DG dg: the derivation graph to hold data for.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not dg.isLocked``.
    .. attribute:: dg

        (Read-only) The derivation graph the object holds data for.
    .. method:: makeDuplicate(e, eDup)

        Create another version of the given hyperedge and give it the given duplicate number.
        It will connect to duplicate 0 of all head and tail vertices.

        :param DGHyperEdge e: a reference to the derivation to duplicate.
        :param int eDup: the duplicate number for the new version of the derivation.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not e``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``e.dg != dg``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if duplicate ``eDup`` already exists for ``e``.
    .. method:: removeDuplicate(e, eDup)

        Remove the version of the given hyperedge with the given duplicate number.

        :param DGHyperEdge e: a reference to the derivation to duplicate.
        :param int eDup: the duplicate number for the version of the derivation to remove.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not e``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``e.dg != dg``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if duplicate ``eDup`` does not exist for ``e``.
    .. method:: reconnectSource(e, eDup, v, vDupTar)

        For the given hyperedge duplicate, reconnect the given source vertex to the given duplicate of that source.
        If the vertex is a source multiple times, then an arbitrary one of them is reconnected.

        :param DGHyperEdge e: a reference to the derivation to reconnect.
        :param int eDup: the duplicate number of the derivation to reconnect.
        :param DGVertex v: a source vertex to reconnect.
        :param int vDupTar: the new duplicate number for the source vertex.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not e``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``e.dg != dg``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not v``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``v.dg != dg``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``v`` is not a source vertex of ``e``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if duplicate ``eDup`` does not exist for ``e``.
    .. method:: reconnectTarget(e, eDup, v, vDupTar)

        For the given hyperedge duplicate, reconnect the given head to the given duplicate of that head.
        If the vertex is a head multiple times, then an arbitrary one of them is reconnected.

        :param DGHyperEdge e: a reference to the derivation to reconnect.
        :param int eDup: the duplicate number of the derivation to reconnect.
        :param DGVertex v: a target vertex to reconnect.
        :param int vDupTar: the new duplicate number for the target vertex.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not e``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``e.dg != dg``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``not v``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``v.dg != dg``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if ``v`` is not a target vertex of ``e``.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if duplicate ``eDup`` does not exist for ``e``.

        Note that assignment to the property copies the argument.

        :type: GraphPrinter
    .. attribute:: withShortcutEdges

        Control whether or not hyperedges :math:`(T, H)` with :math:`|T| = |H| = 1`
        are printed as a simple arrow without the usual rectangle.

        ``label`` with all space characters escaped.

        :type: bool
    .. method:: pushVertexVisible(f)

        Add another function or constant controlling the visibility of vertices.
        All visibility functions must return ``true`` for a vertex to be visible.

        :param f: the function or constant to push for specifying vertex visibility.
        :type f: Callable[[DGVertex], bool] or bool
    .. method:: popVertexVisible()

        Remove the last pushed vertex visibility function.

        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if no callback is left to pop.
    .. method:: pushEdgeVisible(f)

        Add another function or constant controlling the visibility of hyperedges.
        All visibility functions must return ``true`` for a hyperedge to be visible.

        :param f: the function or constant to push for specifying hyperedge visibility.
        :type f: Callable[[DGHyperEdge], bool] or bool
    .. method:: popEdgeVisible()

        Remove the last pushed hyperedge visibility function.

        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if no callback is left to pop.

        :type: str
    .. attribute:: edgeLabelSep

        The string used as separator between each part of each edge label.

        :type: str
    .. method:: pushVertexLabel(f)

        Add another function or constant for vertex labelling.
        The result of this function is added to the end of each label.

        :param f: the function or constant to push for labelling vertices.
        :type f: Callable[[DGVertex], str] or str
    .. method:: popVertexLabel()

        Remove the last pushed vertex labelling function.

        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if no callback is left to pop.
    .. method:: pushEdgeLabel(f)

        Add another function or constant for edge labelling. The result of this function is appended to each label.

        :param f: the function or constant to push for labelling edges.
        :type f: Callable[[DGHyperEdge], str] or str
    .. method:: popEdgeLabel()

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withRuleName

    .. attribute:: withInlineGraphs

        Control whether or not graph depictions should be precompiled, or be included inline in the DG figure.

        :type: bool
    .. method:: pushVertexColour(f, extendToEdges=True)

        Add another function or constant for colouring vertices. The final colour of a vertex is the result of the first colour function returning a non-empty string.
        The functions are evaluated in the order they are pushed and the resulting string is used directly as a colour in Tikz.
        A hyperedge is also coloured if at least one head and one tail *can* be coloured with a colour for which ``extendToEdges`` is ``True``.
        In this case, the hyperedge (and a subset of the head and tail connectors) is coloured with the first applicable colour.
        The edge extension of vertex colour takes lower precedence than explicitly added hyperedge colouring functions.

        :param f: the function to push for colouring vertices.
        :type f: Callable[[DGVertex], str] or str
        :param bool extendToEdges: whether or not some hyperedges are coloured as well (see above).
    .. method:: popVertexColour()

        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if no callback is left to pop.
    .. method:: pushEdgeColour(f)

        Add another function or constant for colouring hyperedges. The final colour of a hyperedge (and all of its head and tail connectors) is the result of the
        first colour function returning a non-empty string.

        :param f: the function or constant to push for colouring hyperedges.
        :type f: Callable[[DGHyperEdge], str] or str
    .. method:: popEdgeColour()

        Remove the last pushed hyperedge colouring function.

        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if no callback is left to pop.
    .. method:: setRotationOverwrite(f)

        Overwrite the rotation set in the nested :class:`GraphPrinter`. The given function will be used
        to set the rotation of each printed graph.

        :param f: the constant or the function called on each graph to retrieve the rotation to render it with.
        :type f: Callable[[Graph], int] or int
    .. method:: setMirrorOverwrite(f)

        Overwrite the mirror set in the nested :class:`GraphPrinter`. The given function will be used
        to set the mirror of each printed graph.

        :param f: the function called on each graph to retrieve the mirror to render it with.
        :type f: Callable[[Graph], bool] or bool
    .. method:: setImageOverwrite(f)

        Overwrite the image generation for graphs depicted in the vertices of the printed derivation graph.
        For each duplicate of each vertex to be depicted, the given callback is called.
        It must then return two strings:

        1. Either

            - an empty string if the standard depiction should be used, in which case the second string is ignored, or
            - the filename of the PDF that should be included in the final compiled figure.

        2. Either

            - an empty string if no additional post-processing command is needed, or
            - a string of Bash code which will be inserted in the post-processing instructions.
              For example, one can write out source code in the callback, and then return a command that compiles
              that code into the PDF needed by inclusion.

        The image overwrite can be removed by calling with ``None``.

        :param f: the callback to use, or ``None`` to remove an existing callback.
        :type f: Callable[[DGVertex, int], tuple[str, str]] or None
    .. attribute:: graphvizPrefix

        The string that will be inserted into generated DOT files,
        just after the graph declaration.

        :type: str
    .. attribute:: tikzpictureOption

        Access the string that will be inserted into generated Tikz files,
        in the options for the ``\tikzpicture`` macro used for the DG.

        :type: str
