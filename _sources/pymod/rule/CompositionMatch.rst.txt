.. class:: RCMatch

    A class for interactively constructing match between two rules used for composition.
    That is, for two rules
    :math:`p_1 = (L_1 \leftarrow K_1 \rightarrow R_1)` and
    :math:`p_2 = (L_2 \leftarrow K_2 \rightarrow R_2)`,
    an object represents match between :math:`R_1` and :math:`L_2` which indicates
    a common subgraph :math:`R_1 \leftarrow M \rightarrow L_2`.

    .. method:: __init__(rFirst, rSecond, labelSettings=LabelSettings(LabelType.String, LabelRelation.Specialisation))

        Construct an empty overlap.

        :param Rule rFirst: the first rule :math:`p_1`.
        :param Rule rSecond: the second rule :math:`p_2`.
        :param LabelSettings labelSettings: the settings to use for the morphisms :math:`R_1 \leftarrow M \rightarrow L_2`.
        :raises LogicError: if either rule is ``None``.
    .. method:: __str__()
    .. attribute:: first
                   second

        (Read-only) The rules :math:`p_1` and :math:`p_2`.

        :type: Rule
    .. attribute:: labelSettings

        (Read-only) The settings for the morphisms in the match.

        :type: LabelSettings
    .. attribute:: size

        (Read-only) The number of currently mapped pairs of vertices.

        :type: int
    .. method:: __getitem__(vFirst)
                __getitem__(vSecond)

        :param Rule.RightGraph.Vertex vFirst: a vertex of :math:`R_1` to return the mapped vertex for.
        :param Rule.LeftGraph.Vertex vSecond: a vertex of :math:`L_2` to return the mapped vertex for.
        :returns: the vertex the given vertex is mapped to, or a null vertex if it is not mapped.
        :raises LogicError: if either vertex is a null vertex.
        :raises LogicError: if either vertex does not belong to their respective rules.
    .. method:: void push(vFirst, vSecond)

        Extend the common subgraph (match) of :math:`R_1` and :math:`L_2`
        by identifying the given vertices from each of the graphs.

        :raises LogicError: if either vertex is a null vertex.
        :raises LogicError: if either vertex does not belong to their respective rules.
        :raises LogicError: if either vertex is already mapped.
        :raises LogicError: if the extension of the match is infeasible.
    .. method:: pop()

        Pop the latest pushed vertex pair.

        :raises LogicError: if ``self.size == 0``.
    .. method:: compose(*, verbose=False)

        :param bool verbose: whether to output debug messages from the composition algorithm.
        :returns: the composition of the two rules along the match.
            If the composition is not defined, ``None`` is returned.
        :rtype: Rule
    .. method:: composeAll(*, maximum=False, verbose=False)

        :param bool maximum: whether to only compose only using the matches of maximum cardinality.
        :param bool verbose: whether to output debug messages from the composition algorithm.
        :returns: the composition of the two rules along enumerated matches.
            The enumerated matches are all those that are extensions of the current match,
            and the match it self.
        :rtype: list[Rule]
