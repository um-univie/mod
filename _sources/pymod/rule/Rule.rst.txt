.. class:: Rule

    This class models a graph transformation rule in the Double Pushout formalism,
    as the span :math:`L \leftarrow K \rightarrow R`.
    The three graphs are referred to as respectively
    the "left", "context", and "right" graphs of the rule.
    See :ref:`graph-model` for more details.

    The class implements the :class:`protocols.Graph` protocol,
    which gives access to a graph view of the rule which has the left, context, and right graphs
    combined into a single graph, called the core graph.
    In addition to the combined graph view that this claas offers,
    there are also three graph views representing the :attr:`left`, :attr:`context`
    See :ref:`py-Rule/GraphInterface` for details of how to use these four graph interfaces.

    .. attribute:: id

        (Read-only) The unique instance id among all :class:`Rule` instances.

        :type: int
    .. attribute:: left

        (Read-only) A proxy object representing the left graph of the rule.

        :type: LeftGraph
    .. attribute:: context

        (Read-only) A proxy object representing the context graph of the rule.

        :type: ContextGraph
    .. attribute:: right

        (Read-only) A proxy object representing the right graph of the rule.

        :type: RightGraph
    .. method:: makeInverse()

        :returns: a rule representing the inversion of this rule.
        :rtype: Rule
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if inversion is not possible (due to matching constraints).
    .. method:: print(printCombined=False)
                print(first, second=None, printCombined=False)

        Print the rule, using either the default options or the options in ``first`` and ``second``.
        If ``first`` and ``second`` are the same, only one depiction will be made.

        :param GraphPrinter first: the printing options used for the first depiction.
        :param GraphPrinter second: the printing options used for the second depiction.
            If it is ``None`` then it is set to ``first``.
        :param bool printCombined: whether a depiction of the rule as a single combined graph is printed.
        :returns: a pair of filename prefixes for the PDF-files that will be compiled in post-processing.
            The actual names can be obtained by appending ``_L.pdf``, ``_K.pdf``, and ``_R.pdf`` for
            respectively the left side, context, and right side graphs.
            If ``first`` and ``second`` are the same, the two file prefixes are equal.
        :rtype: tuple[str, str]
    .. method:: printTermState

        Print the term state for the rule.
    .. method:: getGMLString(withCoords=False)

                  optionally with generated 2D coordinates.
        :rtype: str
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` when coordinates are requested, but
                 none can be generated.
    .. method:: printGML(withCoords=False)

        Print the rule in :ref:`GML <rule-gml>` format,
        optionally with generated 2D coordinates.

        :returns: the filename of the printed GML file.
        :rtype: str
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` when coordinates are requested, but
                 none can be generated.
    .. attribute:: name

        The name of the rule. The default name includes the unique instance id.

        :type: str
    .. attribute:: labelType

        (Read-only) The intended label type for this rule, or None if no specific label type is intended.

        :type: LabelType
    .. attribute:: numLeftComponents

        (Read-only) The number of connected components of the left graph.

        :type: :cpp:type:`std::size_t`
    .. attribute:: numRightComponents

        (Read-only) The number of connected components of the right graph.

        :type: :cpp:type:`std::size_t`
    .. method:: isomorphism(other, maxNumMatches=1, labelSettings=LabelSettings(LabelType.String, LabelRelation.Isomorphism))

        :param Rule other: the other :class:`Rule` for comparison.
        :param int maxNumMatches: the maximum number of isomorphisms to search for.
        :param LabelSettings labelSettings: the label settings to use during the search.
        :returns: the number of isomorphisms found between ``other`` and this rule, but at most ``maxNumMatches``.
        :rtype: int
    .. method:: monomorphism(host, maxNumMatches=1, labelSettings=LabelSettings(LabelType.String, LabelRelation.Isomorphism))

        :param Rule host: the host :class:`Rule` to check for subgraphs.
        :param int maxNumMatches: the maximum number of morphisms to search for.
        :param LabelSettings labelSettings: the label settings to use during the search.
        :returns: the number of monomorphisms from this rule to subgraphs of ``host``, though at most ``maxNumMatches``.

    .. method:: getVertexFromExternalId(id)

        If the rule was not loaded from an external data format, then this function
        always return a null descriptor.

        .. note:: In general there is no correlation between external and internal ids.

        :param int id: the external id to find the vertex descriptor for.
        :returns: the vertex descriptor for the given external id.
                The descriptor is null if the external id was not used.
        :rtype: Vertex
    .. attribute:: minExternalId
                      maxExternalId

        If the rule was not loaded from an external data format, then these attributes
        are always return 0. Otherwise, they are the minimum/maximum external id from which
        non-null vertices can be obtained from :meth:`getVertexFromExternalId`.
        If no such minimum and maximum exists, then they are 0.

        :type: int

Loading Functions
=================

.. staticmethod:: Rule.fromGMLString(s, invert=False, add=True)
                  Rule.fromGMLFile(f, invert=False, add=True)

    Load a rule from a :ref:`GML <rule-gml>` string or file, and maybe store it in a global list.
    The name of the rule is the one specified in the GML string, though when ``invert=True``
    the string ", inverse" is appended to the name.

    .. note::

        If the GML string/file specifies matching constraints it is currently not possible to invert the rule.
        There is however a configuration option to ignore matching constraints when inverting rules.

    :param str s: the GML string to load a rule from.
    :param f: name of the GML file to be loaded.
    :type f: str or CWDPath
    :param bool invert: whether or not to invert the loaded rule.
    :param bool add: whether to append the rule to :data:`inputRules` or not.
    :returns: the rule in the GML string, possibly inverted.
    :rtype: Rule
.. staticmethod:: Rule.fromDFS(s, invert=False, add=True)

    Load a rule from a :ref:`RuleDFS <format-ruleDFS>` string.

    :param str s: the :ref:`RuleDFS <format-ruleDFS>` string to parse.
    :param bool invert: whether or not to invert the loaded rule.
    :param str name: the name of the rule. If none is given the default name is used.
    :param bool add: whether to append the rule to :data:`inputRules` or not.
