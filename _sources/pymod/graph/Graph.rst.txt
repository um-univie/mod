Class ``Graph``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. py:class:: Graph

    This class models an undirected graph with labels on vertices and edges,
    without loops and without parallel edges.
    Certain labels are regarded as models of chemical atoms and bonds.
    See :ref:`mol-enc` for more information on this.

        If the graph was not loaded from an external data format, then this function
        always return a null descriptor.
        If the graph was loaded from a SMILES string, but *any* class label was not unique,
        then the function always return a null descriptor.
